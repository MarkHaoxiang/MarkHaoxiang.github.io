I am a 3rd year computer science student at the University of Cambridge. My research interests concern building robust, generalizeable AI. To this end, I am interested in the intersection between robotic control and reinforcement learning.

Previously, I have interned as a data scientist at 1StepAI and as a software intern for Minimax Labs. I have also worked as an undergraduate researcher with Maciej Trzeciak, generating simulated data for SLAM applications.
