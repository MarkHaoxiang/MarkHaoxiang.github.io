I am a 2nd year computer science student at the University of Cambridge. My research interests concern building robust, generalizable AI in a multi-agent setting. To this end, I am interested in the intersection between robotic control, reinforcement learning, and open ended learning.

Previously, I have interned as a data scientist at 1StepAI. I have also worked as an undergraduate researcher with Maciej Trzeciak, generating simulated data for SLAM applications.
